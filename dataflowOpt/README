# Dataflow Analysis

Group: Xian Zhang (xianz), Yuzhong Zhang (yuzhongz)

## Notice
For the output of the passes, in order to present our whole analysis process, we did not eliminate the output lines that did NOT appear in the assignment 2 guide pdf file, like the output lines accompanying $indvar = phi i32 [0, %bb.nph], [%indvar.next, %bb] in liveness analysis. Please ignore these lines.

## Build Commands:
	// make example testfiles' .ll (available and liveness)
	make examplefile filename="$(FILENAME)"

	// make testfiles 0-5
	make testfile filename="$(FILENAME)"

	make clean

	// this will delete .ll files, which is not necessary most of the time
	make cleanest
	
	// compile and link the source
	make

	// make and run the pass after the former compilations
	// we perform analysis on .ll files
	make RunPass pass="$(PASSNAME)" filename="$(FILENAME)"

where $(FILENAME) is the pure filename without the extension, and $PASSNAME$ is either available for available analysis or liveness for liveness analysis.

### Simplest build method:
PLEASE consider using this method to produce all the files that you need to run tests

	// this cleans and reproduce everything before you run the pass
	make prepare

	make RunPass pass="$(PASSNAME)" filename="$(FILENAME)"

	// just plugin passname (available / liveness) and filename (available-test-m2r / liveness-test-m2r / test0 / .. / test5)
	

## Examples:
	make RunPass pass="liveness" filename="liveness-test-m2r"
	make RunPass pass="available" filename="available-test-m2r"
	make RunPass pass="liveness" filename="test4"
	make RunPass pass="available" filename="test0"

	make examplefile filename="liveness-test-m2r"

	make testfile filename="test0"
	make RunPass pass="available" filename="test0"

	make testfile filename="test1"
	make RunPass pass="available" filename="test1"

    // an example run
    make prepare

    make RunPass pass="available" filename="available-test-m2r"

To make things even easier, you can do stuff like:
	make prepare
	make clean; make; make RunPass pass="available" filename="available-test-m2r" &> test.txt; vim test.txt

	make clean; make; make RunPass pass="liveness" filename="liveness-test-m2r" &> test.txt; vim test.txt
	make clean; make; make RunPass pass="liveness" filename="test0" &> test.txt; vim test.txt
	make clean; make; make RunPass pass="available" filename="test1" &> test.txt; vim test.txt
	make clean; make; make RunPass pass="available" filename="test5" &> test.txt; vim test.txt
	make clean; make; make RunPass pass="liveness" filename="test5" &> test.txt; vim test.txt
