There is a part in the LICM/Makefile, called:
`### Files Registration`
inside which you can simply comment/uncomment the `PASSFILE` and `PASSNAME` to choose the pass you want to run, and change the `FILENAME` to choose test files you wish to use.

(For `FILENAME`, please omit `.c`)

## Testfiles:

Dominator: 
----dom-test0.c

DCE:
----dce_test0.c
----dce_test1.c
----dce_test2.c

LICM:
----loop-invariant.c
----nestedloops_test0.c
----nestedloops_test1.c

## Build Commands:

Before you run, please make sure the `PASSFILE`, `PASSNAME`, `FILENAME` in the Makefile are those you want.

To build and run, just do `make prepare` to make ready the files (EVERY TIME you run a pass), and then run `make RunPass` to run the pass you like.

After every run, you will find the outcome in `LICM/out.ll`, and the original `.ll` file under `tests/`. (Except for dominator pass, whose output is in the standard output)
	
### To clean up	
	
	make clean

	// this will delete .ll files as well
	make cleanest
